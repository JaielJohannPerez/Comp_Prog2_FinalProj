# HARDWARE INVENTORY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
## Objectives

This project aimed to address the issue of emerging companies failing to integrate new inventory management systems by developing a simpler system that saves all output externally to a file. One of the project's goals is to put all the programming ideas we acquired in our computer programming 2 class into practice like <font color="#ffff00">functions</font>, <font color="#ffff00">character manipulation</font>, <font color="#ffff00">structures</font>,<font color="#ffff00"> linked lists </font>and <font color="#ffff00">file handling</font>. The students that created this project also have their own personal goals, which include improving their programming efficiency and problem-solving abilities throughout the project.
