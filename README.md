# HARDWARE INVENTORY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
## Objectives
This project aimed to address the issue of emerging companies failing to integrate new inventory management systems by developing a simpler system that saves all output externally to a file. One of the project's goals is to put all the programming ideas we acquired in our computer programming 2 class into practice like **functions, character manipulation, structures, linked lists and file handling**. The students that created this project also have their own personal goals, which include improving their programming efficiency and problem-solving abilities throughout the project.
